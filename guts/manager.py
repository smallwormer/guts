"""Base Manager class.

Managers are responsible for a certain aspect of the system.  It is a logical
grouping of code relating to a portion of the system.  In general other
components should be using the manager to make changes to the components that
it is responsible for.

We have adopted a basic strategy of Smart managers and dumb data, which means
rather than attaching methods to data objects, components should call manager
methods that act on the data.

Methods on managers that can be executed locally should be called directly. If
a particular method must execute on a remote host, this should be done via rpc
to the service that wraps the manager

Managers should be responsible for most of the db access, and
non-implementation specific data.  Anything implementation specific that can't
be generalized should be done by the Driver.

In general, we prefer to have one manager with multiple drivers for different
implementations, but sometimes it makes sense to have multiple managers.  You
can think of it this way: Abstract different overall strategies at the manager
level(FlatNetwork vs VlanNetwork), and different implementations at the driver
level(LinuxNetDriver vs CiscoNetDriver).

Managers will often provide methods for initial setup of a host or periodic
tasks to a wrapping service.

This module provides Manager, a base class for managers.
